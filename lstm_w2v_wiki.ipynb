We will use 300 dimentional word vectors pre-trained on wikipedia articles. We can also train the w2v model with our data, however our dataset is quite small and trained word vectors might not be as good as using pretrained w2v.\n",

        "#### Deep Network\n",
        "* Deep network takes the sequence of embedding vectors as input and converts them to a compressed representation. The compressed representation effectively captures all the information in the sequence of words in the text. The deep network part is usually an RNN or some forms of it like LSTM/GRU. The dropout can be added to overcome the tendency to overfit, a very common problem with RNN based networks.\n",
